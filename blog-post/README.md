A build pipeline with [Broccoli.js](http://broccolijs.com/),
almost identical to the one in the [broccoli](../broccoli)
folder. After creating the former, I used this one to guide
my writeup on this topic: [A simple asset pipeline with Broccoli.js](http://blog.pablobm.com/post/156209309183/a-simple-asset-pipeline-with-broccolijs)

Install dependencies with:

```
$ yarn
```

Run the build with:

```
$ yarn run build
```

Or run a development server with:

```
$ yarn run serve
```

The resulting app will be served at http://localhost:4200
